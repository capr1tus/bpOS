# bpOS
## what is bpOS?
bpOS is a pseudo terminal-based operating system written in bash.
it comes bundled with a few apps, a login page, an entire filesystem, and the ability to write your own apps and run them.
## why?
bpOS was created just to practice bash, and to make something cool.
## running bpOS
to run bpOS, make sure you are on a linux machine. otherwise, open the repository in a github Codespace (which is linux).

once you are there, run the following command in the terminal:
```
npm install
```
then
```
sh login.sh
``` 
this starts the login sequence.
